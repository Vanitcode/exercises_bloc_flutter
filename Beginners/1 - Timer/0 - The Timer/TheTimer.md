## How to start?

You have 2 folders: challenge and solution. Go to the challenge folder and try it. After that, you can see the step by step solution at the solution folder.

## What I will build here?

In this initial exercise you are going to build a simple Timer mechanic based in the [Bloc Library tutorial](https://bloclibrary.dev/tutorials/flutter-timer/). You will use this mechanic in the future to build a small game.

## What I will learn to here?

* BlocProvider, Flutter widget which provides a bloc to its children.
* BlocBuilder, Flutter widget that handles building the widget in response to new states.
* Prevent unnecessary rebuilds with Equatable.
* Learn to use StreamSubscription in a Bloc.
* Prevent unnecessary rebuilds with buildWhen.
