## How to start?

You have 2 folders: challenge and solution. Go to the challenge folder and try it. After that, you can see the step by step solution at the solution folder.

## What I will build here?

In this initial exercise you are going to build a simple Counter mechanic based in the [Bloc Library tutorial](https://bloclibrary.dev/tutorials/flutter-counter/). You will use this mechanic in the future to build a small game.

## What I will learn to here?

* Observe state changes with **BlocObserver**
* Use some Bloc Flutter Widgets to implement the Business Logic Component pattern such as **BlocProvider** and **BlocBuilder**.
* Get started with **Cubits**
* When to use **Cubits** instead of **Blocs**
